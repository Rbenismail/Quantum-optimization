# Quantum-optimization
Combinatorial optimization problems involve finding the best solution among a finite set of options, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem or the MaxCut Problem.

Two major approaches are commonly used:

Gate-based approach: This quantum computing paradigm relies on quantum gates and is offered by various tech companies like IBM Quantum. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), introduced by Edward Farhi, Jeffrey Goldstone, and Sam Gutmann in 2014, is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. It combines quantum and classical components: quantum gates are used to prepare a quantum state encoding a potential solution, and classical optimization techniques fine-tune the quantum gates' parameters for better results. However, QAOA's effectiveness depends heavily on parameter choice and the structure of the variational quantum circuit. It can face challenges such as barren plateaus and may require deep circuits for certain problems, potentially limiting its scalability.

Adiabatic quantum computing: This approach is purely quantum. It involves mapping the optimization problem to a Hamiltonian, which describes the energy of a physical system, with its ground state representing the optimal solution. The quantum system starts in a known initial state, and the system's Hamiltonian slowly transforms from an initial state (whose ground state is known) to the problem's Hamiltonian (whose ground state represents the solution) over time. This transformation, achieved by gradually changing a parameter in the Hamiltonian (the "annealing schedule"), follows the adiabatic theorem, ensuring the system remains in its ground state throughout the evolution. Ideally, with an appropriate annealing schedule, the quantum system converges to the problem's ground state, corresponding to the optimal solution. Advantages include potential robustness against certain types of noise and imperfections.

However, both approaches face challenges:

Gate-based methods like QAOA may encounter limitations due to parameter selection and circuit complexity, affecting scalability.
Adiabatic quantum computing's scalability is constrained by the time required for adiabatic evolution, which becomes a bottleneck for larger problem sizes. D-Wave Systems is a prominent company in commercializing adiabatic quantum computers.
By leveraging these quantum computing approaches, we aim to tackle complex optimization challenges more efficiently, paving the way for innovative solutions across various industries.
